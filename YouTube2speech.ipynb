month and there will be some other surprises for people on the waiting list let's start with the video we're going to be following andy around at work you're going to listen to five short audio clips each one will have a question or two before or after it make sure you share your scores with me in the comment section there are ten points available i would love to know your scores out of ten are you ready here's the first one andy is negotiating take a look at what he's going to say how would you complete the sentences there are lots of different ways pause the video and think of as many as you can okay let's listen to the two sentences supposing we agree to change the packaging how would you feel that'd would be very expensive could we explore other options did anyone get those two words i imagine many of you said if for the first gap that's absolutely fine you can give yourself a point i'll put some other options in the pdf so check there to see if your answer was included but andy said supposing which asks someone to imagine a situation it can be used instead of if in the first second and third conditional andy used the second conditional supposing plus past simple comma would plus base verb conditional are essential when negotiating and in the second gap we had could if you thought the answer was can full points to however could make the sentence more polite and more form more than can a great business english program will teach you this kind of functional grammar but you can instantly apply during your working day if you're looking for one sign up to the waiting list because it's going to be fantastic alright we're in another meeting now and things are not going well you're going to hear andy express his disappointment and then you're going to hear two responses choose the better response i'm very disappointed with the number of tickets we sold in the last quarter there's certainly room for improvement on my side you have to remember that i told you that ticket sales might fall what do you think what if i told you that both are okay when something goes wrong or you receive negative feedback it might be appropriate to accept the criticism like in the first response but at other times you might be better off respectfully defending yourself if you want to learn both of these skills make sure you join the waiting list the link is in the description box okay let's see how the meeting might continue can you put the words into the correct gaps pause if you need to shall we listen to the answer unfortunately we mis calculated how many people would try to buy tickets at the same time and the website crashed however it was a great learning opportunity for us as a team we immediately hired people to fix it and to ensure it wouldn't happen again how did you do this is an excellent formula for talking about your challenges or failures at work which many of us often need to do the speaker explained the issue then said that they learned something and finally explained what they did to fix the issue what do you notice about the language used a word like miss calculate is a softer way to talk about a failure than saying we failed to or we didn't know okay how many points do you have out of five so far next let's imagine we're still in that meeting trying to come up with a way to sell more tickets look at the sentence complete the gaps the first letter of each word is given shall we listen to the answer i'd like to make sure we're considering this from all angles does anyone have a different point of view did you get those from all angles is a nice high level c qualification and point of view is a phrase i'm sure many of you are familiar with but what's really special about this text is that andy is letting people know he's open to hearing from someone who disagrees and this is so important it's a big part of creating an inclusive culture at work okay score out of eight how you doing the meeting is over but andy has one more stop to make two colleagues have had a disagreement listen and answer the questions afterwards our goal today is to resolve the conflict in a way that works for you both i'd like each of you to share your perspective on what's been happening so you can better understand where the other is coming from are these statements true or false number one andy is not involved in the conflict and number two andy is going to explain what happened to both parties the first one is true andy is playing the role of mediator helping his colleagues resolve the conflict the second one is false andy wants to hear his colleagues explain in their own words what happened being able to help others work out their differences is an important part of the job for many people my professional english program level two will give you the language to do this so how did you do let me know your score out of ten in the comments also make sure you check the pdf first if you're not sure whether
